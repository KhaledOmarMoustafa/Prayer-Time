Manual Testing An Android Application , were i tested the main functions and the UI of the application using Exploratory testing technique .
in this project i had no documentation to follow and a little bit knowledge about the application , so i couldnt generate test cases as there was no requirements 
however the main objective of testing was to find out why the users uninstall the application 
so i ran an exploratory testing to test the main functions and the UI of the application to figure out why the users remove the application after a small period of time. 
in the attached document you can find the bug reports which mainly was generated because the application contains several spelling mistakes which affects the user experience 
and the application integirty , and also it contained several ads that hinder the user experience and blocks the user from using the application since it might be hard to skip 
or close.
